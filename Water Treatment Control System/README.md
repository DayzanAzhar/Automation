# Industrial Water Treatment Control System

This PLC-HMI project controls and monitors key processes in an industrial water treatment facility such as pH regulation and chemical dosing.

## 🛠️ System Overview
- **PLC Program:** `Water Treatment Control System.cxp`
- **HMI Design:** `HMI_Water_Treatment_Control.IPP`
- **Software Used:** Omron CX-Programmer & CX-Designer

## ⚙️ Features
- Automatic monitoring of:
  - pH sensor data
  - Tank level sensors
- Controls:
  - Chemical dosing pumps
  - Drain and fill valves
- HMI Functions:
  - Real-time visualization of tank levels
  - Setpoint input for desired pH values
  - Alarm display for abnormal conditions

## 💡 Learning Objectives
- Develop process control logic with feedback
- Use ladder logic for multi-stage control
- Visualize process states via HMI

## 📷 Preview
*Insert screenshots of ladder logic and HMI layout (optional)*
