# PLC and HMI Automation Projects

Welcome to my repository containing a collection of PLC and HMI-based automation projects. These projects showcase my hands-on experience in industrial control systems, developed using Omron PLCs with CX-Programmer and HMI interfaces designed in CX-Designer.

This repository is part of my portfolio as an Electrical Engineering graduate with a passion for automation, control systems, and smart factory solutions.

## 📁 Project List

### 🔹 [Automated Conveyor Control System](https://github.com/DayzanAzhar/Automation/tree/main/Automatic%20Conveyor%20System)
A sorting conveyor system that detects and classifies items based on color and weight. Includes a PLC ladder program and a simulated HMI interface for monitoring and manual control.
